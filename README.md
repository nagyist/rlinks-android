RLinks for Android
==================

A simple Reddit client for Android. It was developed to demonstrate porting of
an Android application to Nokia Asha software platform and Series 40 touch
devices.

This application is a simple example application created to demonstrate a
porting case of a networked and content-intensive Android application to Series
40 touch devices. For more information on how a similar application was
developed on Series 40, read the porting notes in the RLinks project
(https://github.com/nokia-developer/rlinks) where also the source code of the
ported Series 40 application is hosted.
